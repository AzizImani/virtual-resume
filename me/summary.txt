My name is Abdelaziz Imani. I'm a Senior Software Engineer with 9+ years of experience in backend development, system design, and architecture. Passionate about programming, attentive to details, and committed to finding optimal solutions that transform abstract ideas into impactful products.
I'm originally from Morocco, I love all Halal foods. I'm not allergic, I just hate the taste! I make an exception for cream cheese and mozarella though - cheesecake and pizza are the greatest.
